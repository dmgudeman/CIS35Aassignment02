THE PURPLE GRAPE DISASTER TO TRIUMPH
by Don Eischen

One purple grape doomed by its shape
Dropped through the air plopped on the chair
Sneaked under a dame as she lifted her frame
Its fate was to crush between chair and tush
Made a purple stain like a varicose vein
On the left-hand cheek; it caused her to shriek
She swabbed the spot made a polka dot
She without pause wanted to cause
The stain to erase and leave no trace
She rose from her seat and beat a retreat
To the ladies loo to wipe off the goo
With might and main she attacked the stain
It wouldn't wash out but faded about
To a violet Rorschach all over her back
When she tried to explain her friends would exclaim
On the clever design they said it was fine
But we know where it came it was the stain
Of an errant grape splotched onto her shape
Between seat and rear not worth a tear.
